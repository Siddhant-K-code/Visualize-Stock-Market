# Visualize Stock Market

I'm proud to present Stock Market Visualizer, the best way to view stock/ETF statistics from the comfort of the Python terminal. Search by ticker with live dropdown results and view detailed graphs with information. This was a very cool project to make as it combined my interests in stocks/investing and programming. It was also pretty mathematically challenging to create the graphs.

Note: The YFinance library has large dependencies like numpy and pandas so use the terminal which is next to the code editor (40s package installation), not the full page view (1 min 10s package installation).

## How To Use

Let's say you want to see statistics for an Apple share. Start by typing apple. Then use the dropdown results to figure out the stock ticker - in this case AAPL. After typing the ticker, a graph will pop up with information below. Here's an explanation to help you better understand the information:

  * Ticker: Unique series of letters assigned to security for trading purposes
  * Name: Name of company or security
  * Sector: Sections of an industry or the overall economy
  * Market Cap: Total value of all shares
  * Regular Market Volume: Total number of security traded over a period of time (usually one day)
  * 200 Day Average: Average share price over 200 days
  * 50 Day Average: Average share price over 50 days
  * P/E Ratio: Price to Earning - Share price to earnings per share
  * Trailing P/E: P/E based off last 12 months
  * Forward P/E: P/E based off of projected 12 months
